# Quantitative Finance study

This is my study note on the subject of Quantitative Finance based mainly on the following books:

- Introduces Quantitative Finance, *Paul Whitmott*
- Options, futures, and other derivatives, *John C. Hull*
- The mathematics of financial derivatives, *Paul Whitmott*
- Numerical methods and optimization in finance, *Manfred Gilli*  

Besides the quantitative finance topic, I include here also some supporting knowledge and tools in statistic modelling, mathematical modelling and data science which are useful for the understanding of modelling in finance. These topics include but not limited to:

- probability and statistics
- stochastic processes and calculus
- numerical integration, differentiation
- root-finding algorithms
- finite-difference method for heat-diffusion problem
- time series analysis with statistical techniques
- time series analysis with LSTM

I do hope that in the future I can successfully move to the finance sector and work as a Quantitative Investment Researcher.
