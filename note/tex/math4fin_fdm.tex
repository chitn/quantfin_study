\section{Finite difference method}
\subsection{Introduction}
Illustration with the heat or diffusion equation having the form:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the temperature, $x$ is a spatial coordinate and $t$ is time. Physical meaning of this equation is as follows: (1) consider the flow into and out of a small section of the bar; (2) the flow of heat along the bar is proportional to the spatial gradient of the temperature, hence the derivative of this, the second derivative of the temperature (right-hand side), is the heat retained by the small section; (3) this retained heat causes a change in the temperature (left-hand side).
